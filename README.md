To finish this exciting Level Design subject, now we had to iterate one of the last 2 prototypes, individually.

So for this last activity, I worked alone on an iteration of the Prototype 2.

- Check *A3 - LD Protoype* to see the actual activity request's.
- Check *LD_P3_LDD* to read the results of the level design.
- Check *LD_P3_GDD* to understand the game which the LDD is based on.
